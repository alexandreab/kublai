Kublai API
==========

## Callbacks

All callbacks in Kublai are called with an error and a response and have the form of:

```
function(error, response) {
  if (error) {
    // do something with error
    return
  }
  // do something with response
}
```

Whenever a response is returned it will match the same response as that of the operation in [Khan's API](http://khan-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/API.html).

If additional details are added to the response, those will be detailed in the specific method's docs.

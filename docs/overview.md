Overview
========

What is Kublai? Kublai is a [pomelo](https://github.com/NetEase/pomelo) plugin for the [Khan](http://khan-api.readthedocs.io/) service.

It allows easy integration with your gaming backend, thus enabling easy-to-use clan management operations.

## Features

* **Pomelo Plug-in** - Just point Kublai Plug-in in the direction of your Khan instance and you are good to go;
* **Additional Data** - Kublai builds on top of Khan to ensure that you make as least requests as possible to achieve what you want;
* **Up-To-Date** - Kublai is managed by the same team working on Khan, thus the parity with Khan's features is ensured.

## Who's Using it

Well, right now, only us at TFG Co, are using it, but it would be great to get a community around the project. Hope to hear from you guys soon!

## How To Contribute?

Just the usual: Fork, Hack, Pull Request. Rinse and Repeat. Also don't forget to include tests and docs (we are very fond of both).
